		<td><p>Disadvantages of CSS</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Confusion due to many CSS levels.Beginners are more vulnerable to this issue.</li>
				<li>Security Issues. Security is important in today's world driven by technology and data.</li>
				<li>Extra Work for Developers.</li>
				<li>There are both benefits and drawbacks to being open-source. For example, security risks can arise.</li>
				<li>It is possible to use CSS at various levels. Generally, there are three levels of CSS.</li>
				<li> There are differences between each of the three versions. Beginners and non-developers are hit hardest by this, since it causes confusion.</li>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><p>Difference Between CSS2 And CSS3</p>

			<ul>
			<li>The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there's a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility.</li>
			<li>Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle</li>

			<li>CSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically breaking the text so that it fits within a box.</li>

		<td>Question05:</td>
		<td>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><ul>
			<li>The opacity in CSS is the property of an element that describes the transparency of the element. It is the opposite of transparency & represents the degree to which the content will be hidden behind an element.</li>
			<li>The opacity property is used in the image to describe the transparency of the image. The value of opacity lies between 0.0 to 1.0 where a low value represents high transparency and a high value represents low transparency. The percentage of opacity is calculated as Opacity% = Opacity * 100.</li>

		<td>How can the background color of an element be changed?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><ul>
			<li>To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag. </li>
			<li>Example:<a href="Que06.html">Click here</a></li>

		<td>Question07:</td>
		<td>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><ul><li>To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.</li>
			<li>Example<a href="Que07.html">Click here</a></li>

		<td>Question08:</td>
		<td>What is the use of the background-position property?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><ul><li>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.</li>
			<li>Example:<a href="Que08.html">Click here</a></li>
		</ul>

		<td>Question09:</td>
		<td>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td>The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.<br>
			Example:<a href="Que09.html">Click here</a>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Question10:</td>
		<td>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><p>There are two reasons behind this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</li>
				<li>Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.</li><br>
				Example:<a href="Que10.html">Click here</a>

		<td>Question12:</td>
		<td>How to maintain the CSS specifications?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td>
			<pre>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by browser vendors along with detailed algorithms, code samples and tabular information.

The Specification also include:

1)The syntax and data types of the language
2)Detailed explanation on CSS Selectors
3)How you can assign values to properties
4)The Cascade (the "C" in CSS)
5)How inheritance works
6)The Box Model e.t.c
Explanation on some of these topic are short and easy to understand while others are explained in great detail.

The Specification also specify how stylesheets can be included in your web document and how to target specific 

media e.g print or screen.

The CSS Specification prior to CSS3 was a single Specification, CSS3 on the other hand is divided into Modules which are Independent Specifications that can be worked on by different author(s) at different paces, that's why we have Selector Level-3Specification, CSS Color-4 CSS Backgrounds and so on. Some of these modules are revisions of CSS2.1, and some are newly created, but all fall under the banner of CSS3.

The Specification should be your guide if you need to understand how a specific property or feature works behind the scene and how it works with other CSS properties. And if you are comfortable reading algorithms you won't get bored reading the CSS Specification.

			<ol>
				<li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>

		<td>What is embedded style sheets?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><p>Embedded Stylesheet:</p>
			<ul><li>It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the &lt;style>&lt;/style> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document. Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project. However, if the styles need to be applied across multiple documents, you should link to an external style sheet instead of using individual embedded style sheets. Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which only allow you to address one HTML element at a time.</li></ul></td>

			<li>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.</li>
			<li>The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</li>
		</ul></td>

	<tr>
		<td>Question17:</td>
		<td>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Answer:</td>
		<td><p>The advantages of External Style Sheets are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file.</li>
				<li>In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.</li>
				<li>In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An extra download is essential to import style information for each file</li>
				<li>The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.</li>
				<li>While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.</li>

			<ol>
				<li><b>Element selector:</b> The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name (or tag) for example p, h1, div, span, etc.</li>
